   INTRODUCTION:
  	Firstly a random number (between 0-10) will be used to draw out. Given the probability of player_A winning a point against player_B if 
        she is serving, the function `point' decides  the outcome of the point. To make the program more realistic, one needs to change the way the function `point' decides which player
  	wins a point.



	The winner of a match is when a player wins 3 sets. A sete is won when a player wins 6 games plus the winner has to win by 2 games difference. The set can be won by the score either
	being 7-5 to the winner or 6-6 and a tie breaker has to be played. The winner of that tie breaker is the winner of the game
  
	Players alternate who serves a game. Player also alternate who serves the first game of a set. A game is won when one of the players gets 4 points,
	and has to be 2 points ahead of the opponent.
	
	Points are graded by the first player to serve and the ball keeps on being played back and forth until a player hits the ball out of court or hits the net.

   	A tie breaker is a game in which the first player to score at least
   	seven and be ahead by two wins.  The service in a tie breaker
   	alternates. The player whose turn it would be to serve in a normal
   	game serves once. Thereafter the players alternate serving twice
   	until the tie breaker is over.
